<p><strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong> (Malaysian pronunciation: [ˈkualə, -a ˈlumpo(r), -ʊ(r)]), officially the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur (Malay: <em>Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur</em>) and colloquially referred to as <strong>KL</strong>, is a federal territory and the capital city of <strong>Malaysia</strong>. It is the largest city in <strong>Malaysia</strong>, covering an area of 243 km2 (94 sq mi) with an estimated population of 1.73 million as of 2016.[8] Greater <strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong>, also known as the <em>Klang Valley</em>, is an urban agglomeration of 7.564 million people as of 2018.[4] It is among the fastest growing metropolitan regions in Southeast Asia, in both population and economic development.

<strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong> is the cultural, financial and economic centre of <strong>Malaysia</strong>. It is also home to the Parliament of <strong>Malaysia</strong> and the official residence of the <em>Yang di-Pertuan Agong</em>, the <em>Istana Negara</em>. It first developed as a town serving the tin mines of the region circa 1857, before it became the capital of <strong>Selangor</strong> in 1880 until 1978, and the capital of <strong>Malaya</strong> before the formation of <strong>Malaysia</strong>. The city remained the seat of the executive and judicial branches of the federal government until these were relocated to <strong>Putrajaya</strong> in early 1999.[9] However, some sections of the political bodies still remain in <strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong>.
